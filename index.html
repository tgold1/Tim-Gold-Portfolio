            <p>For the past eleven years I have been working in the non-profit sector. The highlight for me has been the ability to meet people from all across the globe. The decision was made to shift my career to a passion of mine coding. Specifically to learn web development and receive training in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is why I chose to enroll in the full-stack bootcamp to gain valuable training and experience in the deployment of webpages.</p>
            <p>The experience I have gained over the years is demonstrated in my leadership ability, teaching others, being able to collaborate well wtih a team, a passion to fulfill the mission, and the trust to complete the task. I am a family man with a wife, and two sons living in the Philadelphia area. I have the drive the succeed and I look forward to being a part of the world of web development.</p>
