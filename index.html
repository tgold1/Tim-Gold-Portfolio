            <p>For the past eleven years I have been working in the non-profit sector. The highlight for me has been the
                ability to meet people from all across the globe. The decision was made to shift my career to a passion
                of mine coding. Specifically to learn web development and receive training in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                This is why I chose to enroll in the full-stack bootcamp to gain valuable training and experience in the
                deployment of webpages. The experience I have gained over the years is demonstrated in my leadership
                ability, teaching others, being able to collaborate well wtih a team, a passion to fulfill the mission, and the trust to complete the
                task. I am a family man with a wife, and two sons living in the Philadelphia area. I have the drive to succeed
                and I look forward to being a part of the world of web development.</p>
